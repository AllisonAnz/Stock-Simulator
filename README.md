## About The Project

There are so many great stock simulators out there, however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created one! I wanted to create a simulator that I could learn about stock investing, without risking real money. 

Highlights:
* Search stock by their stock symbol, create an account to be able to save stocks to a customized watchlist
* See daily statistics, price changes and charts
* Learn how to manage your simulated investments by buying and selling stock

You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
